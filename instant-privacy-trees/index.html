My potted fiddle leaf fig tree is on a rolling socker plant stand ($6.49 from ikea) and is easy to roll around; These trees showcase dark green leaves and can act as a foundation plant or an accent plant. This shrubby tree features clusters of fragrant white flowers in spring, which become deep purple berries that are good for jam (or to share with the birds). It also has a longer, narrower leaf shape that is a bit darker green.
