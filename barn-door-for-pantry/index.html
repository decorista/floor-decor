Barn Doors Made For A Pantry Furniture From The Barn From furniturefromthebarn.com
If you are looking for a pantry door that is unique, fashionable and brings an additional texture to your kitchen dominated by stone, tile and glass, then the sliding barn door is a great option indeed. The half x barn doors pictured are 30w x 84h x 1 1/2 thick. We decided to go with 10 feet because the 8 foot option would not allow the doors to open wide enough to get to all of the items on the sides of the pantry. Barn style pantry doors are perfect for small homes and kitchens since they don’t have to take up valuable floor space when opened.
