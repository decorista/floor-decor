Grey and White Kitchen Tom Howley From tomhowley.co.uk
The light gray cabinetry contrasts well with the white island, marble countertops and subway tile. One of my favorite looks right now for a kitchen is a mix of grey and white painted cabinets, so we’ve collected 40 beautiful grey and white kitchens. However, when combining the two in a two tone kitchen cabinet style, you have a winning combination. White kitchens can look a little plain, grey kitchens on their own can look too dark.
